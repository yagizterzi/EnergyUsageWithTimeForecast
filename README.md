# Energy Usage with Time Forecast

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting energy usage over time using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical energy consumption data, we aim to build predictive models that help optimize energy management and planning.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Time series forecasting using machine learning models
- Evaluation of predictive performance
- Interactive analysis with Jupyter Notebook
